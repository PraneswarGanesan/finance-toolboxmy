Total Payment Calculation (TMP):
	Loan Amount * ((i* (1  + i)^n) / ((1 + i)^n - 1))

	Where:
		i = Monthly Interest Payment
		n = Number of Payments
	
	To Calculate i:
		Take APR and divide by 12 (Months)


Principal Payment:
	TMP - ( OLB * (Interest Rate(APR) / 12) )




Vars:
	Loan Amount
	APR (Yearly Interest)
	Monthly Interest
	Number of Payments
	Outstanding Loan Balance (OLB)
